Thank you for taking the time to contribute to RigelEngine!
I really appreciate it.

Please read [the contribution guidelines](https://github.com/lethal-guitar/RigelEngine/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you haven't already.

To make the process as smooth as possible for both of us,
I'd ask you to check a few things before submitting your PR:

* [ ] I've compiled the code locally on my machine, and it builds without errors
* [ ] I've launched the game on my machine after making my changes, and I can successfully start a new game from the main menu

If your changes are only touching documentation or similar files,
which have no influence on the behavior of the code,
you can ignore this of course.

Please remove this text before submitting your PR!
